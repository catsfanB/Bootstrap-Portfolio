						<p>
							Seeking an opportunity to leverage my knowledge and experience in ecommerce and digital marketing to further an agile, fast-paced business’ strategic objectives while gaining more direct experience in the mobile space.
						</p>

						<p>
							As an 18+ year ecommerce veteran, I’ve spent my career enthusiastically working to deliver optimal results and create business value in high-growth, fast-paced environments. Expertise I’ve gained during this time includes: B2B and B2C ecommerce, digital performance marketing, program management, P&amp;L management, strategic planning, organizational change management, data-driven business operations and client relationship management. I have had the pleasure of leading a wide range of functional areas: product development, business operations, business intelligence, business development, account management, partner management and project management.
						</p>

						<p>
							For two brief times in my career I worked as a consultant utilizing my expertise to support other organizations in achieving quick results in the areas of ecommerce and multi-channel strategy, performance marketing and product development. My efforts over the past few years have focused on streamlining business operations while serving as a catalyst for growth and expansion, and transitioning companies from static or reduced growth to commercial success.
						</p>

						<p>
							I have a successful record of managing local, remote, in-house, outsourced, domestic and international teams ranging from 3 to over 50 members. While based in the US and Germany, my management experience included the organizational design, recruiting and development of entirely new functional departments. I have had the privilege to work both within and for highly recognizable global brands with annual online sales ranging from <$5MM to >$1B including Orbitz, Groupon, CheapTickets, JC Whitney, Esprit, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, Puma and Tory Burch to name a few.
